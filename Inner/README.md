# The INNER


All the  **related files** are in the “`final`” folder.

The`innerCommon.hpp, innerSimulator.cpp, innerRender.cpp` are the **final version** of the program for grading. They are written in the structure of cuttlebone to be run in the Allosphere. Also, **reference** is written in these three files. 

Besides, `innerFinalVersion.cpp `is the combination of common, simulator and render. It is a **final computer version** of the program.


Since the program is built gradually, there are **step by step experiments** from inner1-inner6.

> Image is cut into pieces > the bumping motion is add to image fragments > interaction is made in onKeyDown > program is restructured with two class preparing for multi-images > multi images are added and arranged > additional sound source is added and made into audio scene > movement is added to image sequence > interaction is redesigned > program is separated into three part for running in allosphere


### Description

"The Inner" is about people’s remembering and forgetting. A tunnel of image fragments is created, and let the audience "go through". Images are cut into fragments using texture coordinate to express the feeling of low resolution in memory. The aliveness of memory is communicated via a bumping motion resembling the heart which is done by visualizing the amplitude envelope of a beating heart sound wave. Audience can interact with the image by holding the spacebar which is a metaphor of remembrance.
